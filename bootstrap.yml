# USAGE for a brand new machine:
#
#      ansible-playbook bootstrap.yml -u root -k --extra-vars "target=dirac-new" --ask-vault-pass
#FIXME: on really brand new machines, perhaps sudo isn't installed, and there are accidentally some tasks in bootstrap that still ask for become: true, so perhaps we fix that by removing those erronous becomes (might not work because pve_server is shared between both), or by setting --become_method=su above
#
# Just to renew ssh hostkeys etc, without having to first turn on ssh PermitRootLogin:
#
#      ansible-playbook bootstrap.yml -u ansible --extra-vars "target=dirac-new" --ask-vault-pass --become

# Fix up an old installation:
# ansible-playbook bootstrap.yml -u tconnors -k --extra-vars "target=maxwell" --ask-vault-pass --become --become-method=su -K

# Fix up an lxc container:
# ansible-playbook bootstrap.yml -u root --diff --extra-vars "target=zm"
