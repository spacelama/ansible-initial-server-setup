# machines with guest configured vlans can be attached to vmbr0.  If
# we go with enx$mac as a name, we end up with interface.vlan names
# beyond 15 characters.  If we use a name such as lan0, then it doesn't
# match proxmox preconceived ideas of what an interface name must look
# like, and we don't end up being able to pass vlan traffic through to a
# VM.  So we're following closely to advice here:
