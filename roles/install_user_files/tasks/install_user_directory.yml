# FIXME: might need to implement "Does {{ ( '~' ~ user ~ '/' ~
# dir_file_or_template.name ) | dirname }} exist?" style tests that
# were in install_dir_file_or_template.yml, to ensure if directory
# already exists but is a symlink, it is not recreated (which fails)
# as a directory.  Not implementing for now because don't want the
# extra tests on every loop, and it appears that we currently don't
# have any links suffering from this.  Also should not affect new
# builds.
