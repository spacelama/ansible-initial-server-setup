    #   SSL Protocol Adjustments:
    #   The safe and default but still SSL/TLS standard compliant shutdown
    #   approach is that mod_ssl sends the close notify alert but doesn't wait for
    #   the close notify alert from client. When you need a different shutdown
    #   approach you can use one of the following variables:
    #   o ssl-unclean-shutdown:
    #	 This forces an unclean shutdown when the connection is closed, i.e. no
    #	 SSL close notify alert is send or allowed to received.  This violates
    #	 the SSL/TLS standard but is needed for some brain-dead browsers. Use
    #	 this when you receive I/O errors because of the standard approach where
    #	 mod_ssl sends the close notify alert.
    #   o ssl-accurate-shutdown:
    #	 This forces an accurate shutdown when the connection is closed, i.e. a
    #	 SSL close notify alert is send and mod_ssl waits for the close notify
    #	 alert of the client. This is 100% SSL/TLS standard compliant, but in
    #	 practice often causes hanging connections with brain-dead browsers. Use
    #	 this only for browsers where you know that their SSL implementation
    #	 works correctly.
    #   Notice: Most problems of broken clients are also related to the HTTP
    #   keep-alive facility, so you usually additionally want to disable
    #   keep-alive for those clients, too. Use variable "nokeepalive" for this.
    #   Similarly, one has to force some clients to use HTTP/1.0 to workaround
    #   their broken HTTP/1.1 implementation. Use variables "downgrade-1.0" and
    #   "force-response-1.0" for this.
    # BrowserMatch "MSIE [2-6]" \
    #		nokeepalive ssl-unclean-shutdown \
    #		downgrade-1.0 force-response-1.0
