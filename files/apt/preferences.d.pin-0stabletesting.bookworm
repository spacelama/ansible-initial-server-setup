# apt-cache policy <packagename> will reveal what priorities you should set here to keep a 
# desired distribution installed.  Use in conjunction with default release settting in 
# /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/release.  We're sticking with stable at quite a low priority right now, 
# because we have to include it for puppet, but want the rest of the machine to still be lenny
# Note that "stable" works as a release here, whereas "squeeze" doesn't seem to work.
