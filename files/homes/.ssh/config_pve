# proxmox by default comes with a /root/.ssh/config with ciphers.  We
# want to mux every connection because otherwise it connects way too
# frequently filling up logs with useless connections

# negated matches are ANDed.  Non negated matches are ORed.
# Doubled negated matches are still ANDed! (but the logic is much easier to understand if you just grep for the expected pairing)
#Match localuser root !exec "[[ %h != pve* ]]"
Match exec "echo %u@%h | grep root@pve"
