# Part of a health check/automatic watchdog for an external
# HA/failover policy engine.

# Given a machine name someone external has decided is unhealthy, we
# are asked to restart it.  We first determine if that machine is
# listed as already running (if it's not running, then someone has
# already detected its failure or it's off for maintenance, and any
# restart/failover policy is decided by proxmox itself), and if so,
# force stop it and restart.  Performs no action is not already
# running/.
