# 2018/12/06: on weinberg, occasionally numlock still asserts via

# be able to comlpetely ullify numlock via
# https://askubuntu.com/questions/80254/how-do-i-turn-off-caps-lock-the-lock-not-the-key-by-command-line/607915:
xkbset nullify mod2
# to clear again:
# xkbset nullify -mod2

# might also be able to use:
# xdotool key Caps_Lock
# xte "key Caps_Lock"
