# 20240127 needed for xterm scrollback buffer not to be
# corrupted.

# #1014625: xterm: screen corruption of scrollback buffer; similar to
# https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=110214 but
# actually not fixed by that ; but also very useful for
# firefox to not chew CPU updating windows that aren't
# visible; probably through:
# https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1820096
# and
# https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1693513

# seems to drop load of all those background browser windows that are
# uselessly endlessly updating into the void; might as well do this
# both when sleeping (because no one cares) and when waking (because
# by definition anything that is about to be shown is the only thing
# we care about)

export DISPLAY=:0

killall picom 2>/dev/null
sleep 5
killall -9 picom 2>/dev/null

picom & # redirection shouldn't be needed with 11.2-0.1 fixing #1053228: < /dev/null >& /dev/null &
